    <p>
      Naught was once an ordinary boy, until his soul was scarred by a rogue 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(personification)" target="_blank">Grim Reaper</a>. 
      Barely clinging to life, he was saved by 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriel" target="_blank">Saint Uriel</a>, 
      the archangel often associated with divine justice and protection. 
      Yet Naught’s soul was too fractured to heal completely. Uriel offered him a choice:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Pass peacefully into the afterlife.</li>
      <li>Or take on the <em>Grace of a Fallen Angel</em> no longer in use, allowing him to live on both as mortal and angelic.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      Naught chose to accept the Grace. This act bound him to 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uriel" target="_blank">Uriel’s Legions</a>, 
      where he served as a soldier of the heavens—yet his soul remained tethered to the mortal world.
      His very first mission as an angel was to confront the rogue reaper who had nearly ended his existence.
    </p>

      Now he is known as: <strong>The Angel of the Tomb</strong>
