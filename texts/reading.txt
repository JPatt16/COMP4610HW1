Reading through roadmap.shâ€™s Front End and Full Stack sections helped me connect the dots on how everything works together in web development. I already had some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from previous education, so the front-end roadmap mostly reinforced what I knew while also pointing me toward the next steps. It showed me that front-end work is not just about making a page look nice. It is also about making it responsive, accessible, and optimized for performance. I also got a clearer idea of why frameworks like React or Vue are so popular and how they help organize larger projects.

The Full Stack roadmap gave me a bigger picture of how the front end and back end come together to create full applications. It explained things like APIs, databases, authentication, and deployment in a way that made the overall process feel more approachable. What stood out to me is that being full stack is not about mastering everything. It is more about understanding enough across different areas so you can connect all the pieces. Overall, I came away with a stronger sense of progression, where my current skills fit, and how I can grow moving forward.
